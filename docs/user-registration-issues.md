# User Registration Implementation Status

## Current Implementation

The Tennessee Justice Bus application has a partially implemented user registration system with the following components:

1. **Registration Form** (`src/app/(auth)/auth/components/sign-up-form.tsx`)

   - Collects first name, last name, email/phone, preferred contact method
   - Validates input using Zod schema
   - Submits to `/api/auth/register` endpoint

2. **Registration API** (`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)

   - Receives and validates registration data
   - Checks for existing users with the same email or phone
   - Creates a new user record in the database

3. **Verification System**

   - Phone verification via SMS (`src/app/api/auth/send-verification/route.ts`)
   - Verification codes stored in database (`verification_codes` table)
   - Offline support for verification attempts (`src/lib/offline-verification.ts`)

4. **NextAuth Integration**
   - Edge-compatible authentication
   - Supports both phone and email verification
   - Token persistence for offline usage

## Known Issues

1. **Verification Flow Issues**

   - Verification code delivery may be unreliable
   - Error handling in the verification process needs improvement
   - Missing clear error messages for failed verification attempts

2. **Registration Completion Problems**

   - Users can get stuck between registration and verification steps
   - No clear way to resume interrupted registration
   - Session may not be properly established after verification

3. **Offline Mode Challenges**

   - Conflict resolution between cached registrations and server state
   - Synchronization issues when returning online
   - Potential duplicate user records when syncing offline registrations

4. **User Experience Gaps**
   - No clear feedback on registration status
   - Missing password recovery or account access mechanisms
   - Incomplete profile completion guidance

## Required Improvements

1. **Verification Flow**

   - Add detailed logging throughout the verification process
   - Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add verification retry mechanisms with proper rate limiting

2. **Registration Process**

   - Create a multi-step registration flow with clear state persistence
   - Implement a way to resume incomplete registrations
   - Add proper handling of edge cases (e.g., changing contact method mid-registration)

3. **Offline Support**

   - Enhance conflict resolution for registration data
   - Implement proper data reconciliation between offline and online states
   - Add user-friendly messaging for offline registration status

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create comprehensive tests for the registration flow
   - Add test cases for offline-to-online transitions
   - Validate the entire registration process end-to-end

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term Fixes**

   - Debug and fix the current verification code delivery
   - Implement better error logging and display for users
   - Add clear status indicators throughout the registration process

2. **Medium-term Improvements**

   - Refactor the registration flow to use a stateful approach
   - Enhance the offline-online synchronization mechanisms
   - Improve the verification code storage and retrieval

3. **Long-term Enhancements**
   - Add account management and profile completion features
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create a comprehensive session management system
