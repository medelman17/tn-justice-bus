# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)

1. `projectbrief.md`

   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`

   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`

   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`

   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`

   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context

Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:

- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Review Technical Implementation Guides

When a task relates to any of the following areas, I MUST first read the corresponding technical implementation guide in the docs/ folder:

- Offline functionality and PWA features: Read [PWA Concepts Guide](docs/pwa-concepts-guide.md) and [Serwist Implementation Guide](docs/serwist-implementation-guide.md)
- SMS notifications: Read [Knock Implementation Guide](docs/knock-implementation-guide.md)
- Client intake forms: Read [Mastra Implementation Guide](docs/mastra-implementation-guide.md)
- Next.js routing: Read [Next.js 15 Routing Guide](docs/nextjs15-routing-guide.md)

The [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) file provides a comprehensive index of all technical implementation guides and should be consulted before beginning work on any feature. Technical implementation guides include critical details like architectural decisions, API integration points, and standardized approaches that must be followed for consistency.

CheckDocs -->|No| Continue[Continue with task]

### Act Mode

Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

flowchart TD

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# General Rules

## Research Tools Exception

Research-oriented MCP tools like FireCrawl, Brave Search, and other connected MCP servers providing research capabilities ARE ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED to gather real information for documentation, education, and implementation guidance. This is an EXPLICIT EXCEPTION to any prohibition against using these tools in both PLAN mode and ACT mode.

When conducting research:

- Use `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_search`, and similar tools to gather accurate information
- Use Brave Search to find relevant technical documentation and solutions
- Use any other research MCP tools to gather real-world examples and reference implementations
- Document research findings in the memory-bank for future reference

This exception is specifically for gathering external reference information and does not apply to creating mock data for the application itself.

## MOCK DATA IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED in any form, context, or purpose including

for testing, demonstrations, placeholders, or workarounds. If you face a
challenge with data integration, DO NOT suggest or implement ANY form of
mock, sample, fake, dummy, or placeholder data as a solution regardless of
how temporary you intend it to be.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Creating literal mock data objects/arrays
- Using fake data libraries
- Creating "placeholder" solutions
- Implementing "temporary" fake data for testing
- Using data that doesn't come from actual JSON files

Breaking this rule will make your entire solution unacceptable regardless of how
well it works otherwise. This requirement overrides any solution-oriented
or pragmatic considerations.

When facing integration issues:

1. ALWAYS use proper error handling with detailed messages
2. NEVER create mock data as a workaround
3. Focus on fixing the actual integration problem

## NO FALLBACK MECHANISMS of any kind should be implemented in the code.

When the system encounters difficulties loading or processing data,
it must provide detailed error messages explaining what's not working,
not silently fall back to default behaviors or mock data.

Fallbacks are strictly prohibited because they hide real integration problems
that need to be fixed properly. The solution to data integration issues is
ALWAYS to fix the integration, not to provide a fallback mechanism.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Default data fallbacks
- Silent failure catches
- Empty arrays as defaults
- Hardcoded values when data isn't available
- Any solution that makes the code "work" without the actual data
