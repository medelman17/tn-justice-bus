## Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Client Screening and Preparation Proof of Concept

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** April 12, 2025  
**Document Owner:** Tennessee Access to Justice Commission

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a proof of concept (POC) leveraging Claude AI to enhance the Tennessee Justice Bus initiative through an automated pre-visit client screening and preparation system. The POC aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Justice Bus program by helping clients prepare for their legal consultations in advance, streamlining intake processes, and maximizing the impact of limited attorney time in rural "legal desert" communities.

## 2. Problem Statement

The Tennessee Justice Bus program faces several challenges in delivering legal services to rural communities:

- Limited time in each community restricts the number of clients attorneys can serve
- Unprepared clients often require significant time for initial intake and issue identification
- Attorneys may not have all required documentation during the brief visit
- Rural residents may not know what information is relevant to their legal issues
- The program lacks efficient methods to pre-screen and prepare clients before visits

These challenges reduce the effectiveness of the Justice Bus program and limit the number of rural Tennesseans who can receive legal assistance.

## 3. Project Goals

1. Increase the number of clients successfully served during Justice Bus visits by 30%
2. Reduce time spent on initial intake and documentation gathering by 50%
3. Ensure clients arrive at Justice Bus consultations with organized documentation
4. Improve matching of client legal needs with appropriate volunteer attorneys
5. Create a scalable solution that can be expanded statewide if successful
6. Gather data on rural legal needs to better inform future Justice Bus routing
