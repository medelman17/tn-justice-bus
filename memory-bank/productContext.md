# Product Context: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Client Screening Application aims to enhance the effectiveness of the Justice Bus initiative by preparing clients _before_ their consultations. The vision is to bridge the access-to-justice gap in rural Tennessee by making the limited time attorneys have during Justice Bus visits significantly more productive.

## 2. Problem Space

Rural Tennessee communities face a critical shortage of legal representation, often referred to as "legal deserts." Key challenges include:

- **Attorney Scarcity**: Only ~2% of attorneys practice in rural areas, despite 14% of the US population living there. 40% of US counties have less than 1 lawyer per 1,000 residents.
- **Geographic Barriers**: Residents often travel long distances for basic legal services.
- **Limited Justice Bus Time**: The program has constrained time in each location.
- **Client Preparedness**: Unprepared clients require substantial time for intake and issue identification during brief consultations.
- **Connectivity Issues**: Rural internet access can be unreliable, complicating digital solutions.

These factors combine to limit the impact of the Justice Bus and the number of individuals who can receive meaningful assistance.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

The primary goals are to:

1.  **Increase Client Capacity**: Serve 30% more clients per visit.
2.  **Reduce Intake Time**: Cut initial intake/documentation time by 50%.
3.  **Improve Client Preparation**: Ensure clients arrive with necessary documents.
4.  **Enhance Attorney Matching**: Better align client needs with volunteer expertise.
5.  **Scalability & Rural Focus**: Create a solution effective in low-connectivity areas, expandable statewide.
6.  **Data Gathering**: Collect insights on rural legal needs for program planning.

## 4. Target Audience

- **Primary Users**: Rural Tennessee residents needing civil legal aid (housing, family, benefits, consumer issues). This includes adults of varying ages and digital literacy levels.
- **Secondary Users**: Volunteer attorneys, legal aid staff, and potentially rural court staff.

## 5. User Experience Principles

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory. Design must support users with disabilities and varying technical skills.
- **Simplicity**: Use plain language (6th-grade reading level), avoid jargon, and employ progressive disclosure to prevent overwhelm.
- **Guidance**: Provide clear instructions and contextual help throughout the process.
- **Trust & Confidentiality**: Ensure users feel secure sharing sensitive information. Clearly distinguish between legal information and legal advice.
- **Offline First**: Design for intermittent connectivity, allowing users to save progress and continue offline.
- **Multi-lingual**: Support English and Spanish initially, with potential for other languages.

## 6. Key Value Propositions

- **For Clients**: Easier access to preparation tools, reduced stress, better organization, increased likelihood of receiving help.
- **For Attorneys**: More efficient use of consultation time, better-prepared clients, ability to serve more people effectively.
- **For Legal Aid Orgs**: Streamlined intake, better resource allocation, data-driven insights into community needs.
