## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Stack**: Confirmed commitment to Next.js 14+, Vercel platform (for deployment, KV, Blob), Supabase (for PostgreSQL database), Knock (for SMS), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, NextAuth.js, and Claude AI. Researched Next.js 15 routing features and NextAuth.js v5 for future upgrades.
- **Authentication System**: Optimized NextAuth.js implementation by removing the Supabase adapter and using CredentialsProvider for both email and phone authentication, which better aligns with our JWT-based session strategy and offline-first approach.
- **Verification System Enhancement**: Planning to improve the SMS verification system with secure code storage, proper integration with Knock, and enhanced security measures.
- **Deployment Workflow**: Using Vercel CLI for interacting with deployments, managing environment variables, and monitoring application status from the command line.
- **Package Manager**: Using `pnpm` as requested.
- **Architecture**: Adhering to the JAMstack and serverless patterns outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **State Management**: Leaning towards React Query/SWR for server state, Context API for global UI state (needs final confirmation between React Query/SWR if both aren't used).
- **Development Team**: Currently a solo developer effort. Documentation and clear patterns are crucial.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Offline-First**: Design and implementation must prioritize functionality in low/no connectivity environments.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**: Non-negotiable requirement influencing UI/UX design and component implementation.
- **Security & Privacy**: High priority due to sensitive legal data. Follow best practices for encryption, access control, and data handling.
- **Clear AI Boundaries**: Ensure Claude AI provides information, not legal advice. Implement safeguards and clear user disclaimers.
- **Documentation-Driven**: Maintain the Memory Bank diligently as the single source of truth, especially given the solo developer context initially.
- **Edge Compatibility**: Ensure critical components like authentication middleware can run in edge environments for optimal performance.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- The project has well-defined goals and detailed technical/product requirements documented in `projectBrief.md`, `justice-bus-tdd.md`, and `tn-justice-bus-prd.md`.
- The Vercel ecosystem is central to the technical strategy.
- Addressing rural connectivity challenges (offline-first) is a core technical challenge.
- Balancing AI assistance with legal/ethical constraints is critical.
- Next.js 15's routing features (especially Error Handling, Loading States, and Intercepting Routes) align well with our offline-first requirements and could enhance the user experience in low-connectivity environments.
- Next.js 15 changes page component props from synchronous to Promise-based, which would require updating all existing page components during migration.
- NextAuth.js v5 introduces significant architectural changes that improve edge compatibility but require careful migration planning, which we have now successfully implemented.
- The split configuration approach for NextAuth.js v5 successfully addresses the edge compatibility requirements while maintaining database adapter functionality.
- The current SMS verification approach works for development but needs enhancement for production security.

_This document reflects the project state after bootstrapping the Next.js application, implementing the authentication system, setting up Vercel deployment with CLI access, implementing the user dashboard interface with profile and case management, creating a responsive home page, researching Next.js 15 routing features, implementing robust offline capabilities with service workers, implementing the Knock SMS notification system with offline support, successfully migrating to NextAuth.js v5 with edge compatibility, implementing the comprehensive Justice Bus events system, and implementing the admin user management dashboard with full CRUD operations._
