  - Pushed initial documentation and Memory Bank files
- **Next.js Application Bootstrapped**:
  - Created Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
  - Set up proper directory structure with `/src` organization
  - Configured essential files (next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, postcss.config.mjs)
  - Added initial public assets
  - Created basic app layout structure
- **UI Component Library Setup**:
  - Installed and configured Shadcn UI components
  - Set up Tailwind configuration for the component system
  - Added CSS variables in globals.css for theming
  - Created components.json for Shadcn UI configuration
  - Installed all necessary UI components for authentication and main features
- **Authentication Implementation**:
  - Created complete authentication flows for email and phone-based sign-in
  - Implemented NextAuth.js with Supabase adapter integration
  - Built user registration with multiform sign-up
  - Added email and SMS verification processes
  - Created protected routes with middleware
  - Implemented offline-ready authentication with JWT token storage
  - Added user type definitions for improved type safety

## 3. Immediate Next Steps

1.  ~~**Complete Memory Bank**: Create `progress.md` to establish the baseline project status.~~ ✓
2.  ~~**Initialize Next.js Project**: Bootstrap the application with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.~~ ✓
3.  ~~**Database Implementation**: Set up core database schema with Drizzle ORM and Supabase PostgreSQL.~~ ✓
4.  ~~**UI Component Library**: Install and configure Shadcn UI components.~~ ✓
5.  ~~**Authentication System**: Implement NextAuth.js with Supabase adapter and create sign-in/sign-up flows.~~ ✓
6.  **Continue Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
    - **User Dashboard**:
      - Create user dashboard layout with user profile information
      - Add case overview and application status displays
      - Implement settings management for user preferences
    - **Offline Support**:
      - Enhance the current JWT-based offline authentication
      - Add service worker for caching API requests
      - Implement background synchronization for offline data
    - **Notification System**:
      - Set up Knock SMS integration for functional SMS verification
      - Create email notification templates
      - Implement appointment reminders
    - **Vercel Deployment**:
      - Configure GitHub connector for automatic deployment
      - Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
      - Deploy to staging environment for testing

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Stack**: Confirmed commitment to Next.js 14+, Vercel platform (for deployment, KV, Blob), Supabase (for PostgreSQL database), Knock (for SMS), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, NextAuth.js, and Claude AI.
- **Package Manager**: Using `pnpm` as requested.
- **Architecture**: Adhering to the JAMstack and serverless patterns outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **State Management**: Leaning towards React Query/SWR for server state, Context API for global UI state (needs final confirmation between React Query/SWR if both aren't used).
- **Development Team**: Currently a solo developer effort. Documentation and clear patterns are crucial.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Offline-First**: Design and implementation must prioritize functionality in low/no connectivity environments.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**: Non-negotiable requirement influencing UI/UX design and component implementation.
- **Security & Privacy**: High priority due to sensitive legal data. Follow best practices for encryption, access control, and data handling.
- **Clear AI Boundaries**: Ensure Claude AI provides information, not legal advice. Implement safeguards and clear user disclaimers.
- **Documentation-Driven**: Maintain the Memory Bank diligently as the single source of truth, especially given the solo developer context initially.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- The project has well-defined goals and detailed technical/product requirements documented in `projectBrief.md`, `justice-bus-tdd.md`, and `tn-justice-bus-prd.md`.
- The Vercel ecosystem is central to the technical strategy.
- Addressing rural connectivity challenges (offline-first) is a core technical challenge.
- Balancing AI assistance with legal/ethical constraints is critical.
