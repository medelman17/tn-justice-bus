# Project Progress: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

**Date:** April 12, 2025 (Updated - Software Planning Tool Integration)

## 1. Current Status: Foundation Phase

The project has completed the initial setup, bootstrapping, database implementation, UI component installation, authentication system implementation, home page creation, and user dashboard implementation phases (Week 1-3 of Phase 1). The Next.js application structure is in place with a fully defined database schema using Drizzle ORM, Shadcn UI components installed, a complete authentication system with email and phone-based sign-in flows, a responsive home page, and a user dashboard with profile and case management. Additionally, we've successfully integrated the Software Planning Tool MCP server for enhanced project planning capabilities.

**Overall Progress**: 50%

## 2. Completed Work

- All previous work documented in previous progress.md updates
- **Software Planning Tool Integration**:
  - Successfully installed and configured the Software Planning Tool MCP server
  - Demonstrated its capabilities by initiating a planning session for a React-based dashboard application
  - Used the tool to identify primary data sources for the dashboard and save the implementation plan
- **Offline Support Implementation**:
  - Implemented service workers using Serwist (modern fork of Workbox)
  - Created custom caching strategies for different content types
    - Network-first with fallback for API requests
    - Cache-first for static assets (images, fonts)
