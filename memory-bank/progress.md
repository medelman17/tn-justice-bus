# Project Progress: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

**Date:** April 12, 2025 (Updated - Next.js 15 Route Groups Implementation)

## 1. Current Status: Foundation Phase

The project has completed the initial setup, bootstrapping, database implementation, UI component installation, authentication system implementation, home page creation, user dashboard implementation, offline support, notification system implementation, and Next.js 15 Route Groups implementation phases (Week 1-3 of Phase 1). The Next.js application structure is in place with a fully defined database schema using Drizzle ORM, Shadcn UI components installed, a complete authentication system with email and phone-based sign-in flows, a responsive home page, and a user dashboard with profile and case management. We've successfully integrated the Software Planning Tool MCP server for enhanced project planning capabilities, implemented a comprehensive offline-first architecture including an SMS notification system with Knock, organized our code using Next.js 15 Route Groups, and are now planning the integration of Mastra for enhanced client intake forms.

**Overall Progress**: 65%

## 2. Completed Work

- All previous work documented in previous progress.md updates
- **Next.js 15 Route Groups Implementation**:
  - Reorganized application routes using Next.js 15 Route Groups:
    - `(auth)` for authentication-related routes
    - `(dashboard)` for dashboard-related features
    - `(offline)` for offline functionality
  - Maintained original URL structure by creating subdirectories within route groups:
    - `(auth)/auth/` → `/auth/`
    - `(dashboard)/dashboard/` → `/dashboard/`
    - `(offline)/offline/` → `/offline/`
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/route-groups-implementation.md`
  - Updated `docs/README.md` to include the new implementation guide
  - Verified functionality through extensive testing
  - Phase 1 of Next.js 15 migration completed with focus on route organization
- **Mastra Framework Implementation Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive implementation guides for Mastra AI agent framework integration:
    - Created detailed `mastra-implementation-guide.md` with code examples, architecture diagrams, and cost optimization strategies
    - Developed `mastra-system-integration-guide.md` with detailed integration architecture for all existing systems
    - Updated `knock-implementation-guide.md` with Mastra-specific notification workflows
    - Enhanced `serwist-implementation-guide.md` with offline support for Mastra components
  - Designed complete offline-first architecture for client intake forms:
    - Vector database caching for Tennessee legal knowledge base
    - Workflow state persistence in IndexedDB
    - Background synchronization for completed intake forms
    - Graceful degradation of AI capabilities when offline
  - Developed cost optimization strategies for Claude API usage:
    - Tiered model approach (Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex reasoning)
    - Context window management with summarization techniques
    - Prompt engineering optimizations and token usage reduction
    - Caching and reuse system for common responses
    - Comprehensive usage monitoring and analytics
- **Documentation Reorganization**:
  - Moved and improved Mastra implementation plan to a formal implementation guide in `docs/mastra-implementation-guide.md`
  - Enhanced and moved Next.js 15 routing documentation to `docs/nextjs15-routing-guide.md`
  - Updated `docs/README.md` to include references to both new implementation guides
  - Updated `.clinerules` file to require checking docs/README.md before working on related features
  - Added explicit permission for using research-oriented MCP tools in both PLAN and ACT modes
  - Removed duplicate files from memory-bank after migrating to docs directory
  - Created centralized documentation structure with consistent formatting
- **Software Planning Tool Integration**:
  - Successfully installed and configured the Software Planning Tool MCP server
  - Demonstrated its capabilities by initiating a planning session for a React-based dashboard application
  - Used the tool to identify primary data sources for the dashboard and save the implementation plan
- **Offline Support Implementation**:
  - Implemented service workers using Serwist (modern fork of Workbox)
  - Created custom caching strategies for different content types
    - Network-first with fallback for API requests
    - Cache-first for static assets (images, fonts)
    - StaleWhileRevalidate for JS/CSS files
  - Added offline form submission with background synchronization
  - Enhanced JWT token caching for offline authentication
  - Added offline fallback page for improved UX
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs` directory:
    - Detailed Serwist implementation guide
    - PWA concepts reference guide
    - Documentation index and overview
- **Knock SMS Notification System**:
  - Implemented Knock SDK integration for SMS notifications
  - Created core utilities for managing notifications with offline support
  - Developed API routes for triggering notifications:
    - Standard notification trigger endpoint
    - Queue processing endpoint for offline-first functionality
  - Enhanced offline utilities to support notification queuing and processing
  - Integrated with existing authentication system for phone verification
  - Created appointment notification functions for:
    - Verification codes during authentication
    - Scheduled appointment reminders with various timing options
    - Immediate notifications for urgent updates
    - Status change notifications for appointments
  - Implemented testing UI for notification development and debugging
  - Added dashboard navigation for notifications access
  - Created comprehensive implementation guide for Knock integration

## 3. Work In Progress

- Continuing with the current phase (Phase 1: Foundation - Weeks 1-4)
- Enhancing offline-ready data synchronization for rural environments
- Implementing client intake form flows
- Planning Phase 2 of Next.js 15 migration (Promise-based props)

## 4. Next Steps & Upcoming Milestones (Phase 1: Foundation - Weeks 1-4)

1. Continue with the current phase:
   - Enhance offline support capabilities with more advanced synchronization
