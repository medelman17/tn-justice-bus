# Project Progress: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

**Date:** April 12, 2025 (Updated - Knock SMS Notification System)

## 1. Current Status: Foundation Phase

The project has completed the initial setup, bootstrapping, database implementation, UI component installation, authentication system implementation, home page creation, user dashboard implementation, offline support, and notification system implementation phases (Week 1-3 of Phase 1). The Next.js application structure is in place with a fully defined database schema using Drizzle ORM, Shadcn UI components installed, a complete authentication system with email and phone-based sign-in flows, a responsive home page, and a user dashboard with profile and case management. We've successfully integrated the Software Planning Tool MCP server for enhanced project planning capabilities, and implemented a comprehensive offline-first architecture including an SMS notification system with Knock.

**Overall Progress**: 60%
