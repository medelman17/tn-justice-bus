- **Authentication UI**:
  - Created sign-in page with email and phone tabs
  - Built sign-up flow with first/last name and contact preference
  - Implemented verification pages for email and SMS codes
  - Added form validation using Zod
  - Styled all forms using Shadcn UI components
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Enhanced `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` with Supabase integration
