# Project Progress: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

**Date:** April 14, 2025 (Updated - Testing Framework Implementation)

## 1. Current Status: Foundation Phase

The project has completed the initial setup, bootstrapping, database implementation, UI component installation, authentication system implementation, home page creation, user dashboard implementation, offline support, notification system implementation, Next.js 15 Route Groups implementation, NextAuth.js v5 migration, Justice Bus Events implementation, SMS Verification Enhancement implementation, Client Intake System implementation, Admin Dashboard implementation, and Testing Framework Implementation phases (Week 1-3 of Phase 1). The Next.js application structure is in place with a fully defined database schema using Drizzle ORM, Shadcn UI components installed, a complete authentication system with email and phone-based sign-in flows, a responsive home page, and a user dashboard with profile and case management. We've successfully integrated the Software Planning Tool MCP server for enhanced project planning capabilities, implemented a comprehensive offline-first architecture including an SMS notification system with Knock, organized our code using Next.js 15 Route Groups, successfully migrated to NextAuth.js v5 with edge compatibility, implemented a complete Justice Bus events tracking system with offline support and responsive UI components, enhanced the SMS verification system with secure code storage, rate limiting, and offline support, implemented an AI-powered client intake system with Mastra framework, created a comprehensive admin dashboard for user management with CRUD operations, and set up a testing framework for offline functionality using Vitest.
