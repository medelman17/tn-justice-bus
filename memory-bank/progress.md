# Project Progress: Tennessee Justice Bus Pre-Visit Screening

**Date:** April 13, 2025 (Updated - Justice Bus Events Implementation)

## 1. Current Status: Foundation Phase

The project has completed the initial setup, bootstrapping, database implementation, UI component installation, authentication system implementation, home page creation, user dashboard implementation, offline support, notification system implementation, Next.js 15 Route Groups implementation, NextAuth.js v5 migration, and Justice Bus Events implementation phases (Week 1-3 of Phase 1). The Next.js application structure is in place with a fully defined database schema using Drizzle ORM, Shadcn UI components installed, a complete authentication system with email and phone-based sign-in flows, a responsive home page, and a user dashboard with profile and case management. We've successfully integrated the Software Planning Tool MCP server for enhanced project planning capabilities, implemented a comprehensive offline-first architecture including an SMS notification system with Knock, organized our code using Next.js 15 Route Groups, successfully migrated to NextAuth.js v5 with edge compatibility, and implemented a complete Justice Bus events tracking system with offline support and responsive UI components.

**Overall Progress**: 75%
