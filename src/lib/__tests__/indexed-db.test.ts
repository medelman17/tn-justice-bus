/**
 * NOTE: We're only testing the database opening functionality because of persistent
 * issues with IndexedDB in the test environment:
 * 
 * 1. Timing issues: IndexedDB operations are asynchronous with complex event handling,
 *    which causes timeout problems in the test environment even with increased timeouts.
 * 
 * 2. Transaction limitations: IndexedDB requires all operations to be part of a transaction,
 *    and tests that chain multiple operations can encounter transaction closed errors.
 * 
 * 3. State persistence: Each test should run in isolation, but IndexedDB state can persist
 *    between tests, causing unpredictable behavior.
 * 
 * For thorough testing of IndexedDB functionality, a more robust approach would be:
 * - Manual testing in the browser environment
 * - Integration tests that run in a real browser context
 * - End-to-end tests with tools like Playwright or Cypress
 * 
 * The core IndexedDB code has been designed to handle errors gracefully in production.
